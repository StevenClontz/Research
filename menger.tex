  \begin{definition}
    $X$ is \textbf{Menger} if for all open covers $\mathcal{U}_0,\mathcal{U}_1,\dots$ there exist finite subcollections $\mathcal{F}_n \subseteq \mathcal{U}_n$ such that $\bigcup_{n<\omega} \mathcal{F}_n$ is a cover of $X$.
  \end{definition}

  \begin{proposition}
    $\sigma$-compact $\Rightarrow$ Menger $\Rightarrow$ Lindelof
  \end{proposition}

  \begin{definition}
    In the two-player game $\mengame{X}$ player $C$ chooses open covers $\mathcal{U}_n$ of $X$, followed by player $F$ choosing a finite subcollection $\mathcal{F}_n\subseteq\mathcal{U}_n$. $F$ wins if $\bigcup_{n<\omega} \mathcal{F}_n$ is a cover of $X$.
  \end{definition}

  \begin{theorem}
    $X$ is Menger if and only if $C \not\win \mengame{X}$.
  \end{theorem}

  \begin{proof}
    First, suppose $X$ wasn't Menger. Then there would exist open covers $\mathcal{U}_0,\mathcal{U}_1,\dots$ of $X$ such that for any choice of finite subcollections $\mathcal{F}_n\subseteq\mathcal{U}_n$, $\bigcup_{n<\omega} \mathcal{F}_n$ isn't a cover of $X$. Thus $C\prewin\mengame{X} \Rightarrow S \not\win\mengame{X}$.

    The other direction is based upon Gruenhage's topological game presentation. Assume $X$ is Menger, and consider a strategy for $C$ in $\mengame{X}$.

    Since $X$ is Lindelof, we can assume $C$ plays only countable covers of $X$. Then, since $F$ is choosing finite subsets, we may assume $F$ chooses some initial segement of the countable cover. In turn, we can assume $C$ plays an increasing open cover $\{U_0,U_1,\dots\}$ where $U_n\subseteq U_{n+1}$. And in that case, it's suffient to assume $F$ simply chooses a singleton subset of each cover. And finally, since choices made by $F$ are already covered, we can assume that every open set in a cover played by $C$ covers the sets chosen by $F$ previously.

    As a result, we have the following figure of a tree of plays which I need to draw:

    (Insert figure here.)

    Note that for $a,b\in\omega^{<\omega}$ and $m\leq n$, we know:
      \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item $U_{a\concat m}\subseteq U_{a\concat n}$ \\ (for example, $U_{1627} \subseteq U_{1629}$ - increasing the final digit yields supersets)
        \item $U_a \subseteq U_{a\concat b}$ \\ (for example, $U_{1627}\subseteq U_{162789}$ - appending any sequence to the end yields supersets)
        \item $U_{a\concat m} \subseteq U_{a\concat n} \subseteq U_{a\concat n\concat b} \subseteq U_{a\concat n\concat b\concat m}$ \\ (for example: $U_{1627} \subseteq U_{1629283287}$ - injecting a subseqence with initial number larger than the original's final number, prior to the final number, yields supersets) 
      \end{enumerate}

    We may observe that if $F$ can find an $f:\omega\to\omega$ such that $\bigcup_{n<\omega}U_{f\rest (n+1)} = X$, she can use $\{U_{f\rest 0}\}, \{U_{f\rest 1}\}, \dots$ to counter $C$'s strategy.

    Let $\ds V_k^n = \bigcap_{a\in\omega^{\leq n}} U_{a\concat k}$. We claim that (1) $V_k^n$ is open, (2) $\mathcal{V}^n=\{V_0^n,V_1^n,\dots\}$ is increasing, and (3) $\mathcal{V}^n$ is a cover. Proofs:

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item
      Since due to (c) for each $b\in \omega^{\leq n} \setminus k^{\leq n}$, there is an $a\in k^{\leq n}$ with $U_{a\concat k} \subseteq U_{b\concat k}$: \[\ds V_k^n = \bigcap_{a\in\omega^{\leq n}} U_{a\concat k} = \bigcap_{a\in k^{\leq n}} U_{a\concat k} \cap \bigcap_{b\in \omega^{\leq n} \setminus k^{\leq n}} U_{b\concat k} = \bigcap_{a\in k^{\leq n}} U_{a\concat k}\] making $V_k^n$ a finite intersection of open sets.

      \item
      We show $V_k^0\subseteq V_{k+1}^0$:
      \[
        V_k^0 = U_k \subseteq U_{k+1} = V_{k+1}^0
      \]
      and then assume $V_k^{n}\subseteq V_{k+1}^{n}$:
      \[
        V_k^{n+1} = 
        \bigcap_{a\in{\omega}^{\leq n+1}} U_{a\concat k} = 
        V_k^{n} \cap \bigcap_{a\in{\omega}^{n+1}} U_{a\concat k} \subseteq
        V_{k+1}^{n} \cap \bigcap_{a\in{\omega}^{n+1}} U_{a\concat (k+1)} =
        V_{k+1}^{n+1}
      \]

      \item
      We easily see that $\mathcal{V}^0=\{U_0,U_1,\dots\}$ is a cover, and then assume $\mathcal{V}^n$ is a cover.

      Let $x\in X$ and pick $l<\omega$ such that $x \in V^n_l$. For $a \in l^{n+1}$ choose $l_a$ such that $x\in U_{a\concat l_a}$, giving
      \[ x \in \bigcap_{a\in l^{n+1}} U_{a\concat l_a} \]
      
      We will assume $k>l,l_a$ for all $a\in l^{\leq n+1}$. 

      For any $a\in k^{n+1}\setminus l^{n+1}$ note that $a = b\concat c$ where $b\in l^{\leq n}$ and $c$ begins with a number $l$ or greater:
      \[
        V^n_l \subseteq 
        U_{b\concat l} \subseteq 
        U_{b\concat c} \subseteq
        U_{b\concat c\concat l_a} = 
        U_{a\concat l_a}
      \]

      Thus:
      \[ 
        x \in 
        V^n_l \cap \left(\bigcap_{a\in l^{n+1}} U_{a\concat l_a}\right) 
      \]
      \[
        =
        V^n_l \cap \left(\bigcap_{a\in k^{n+1}\setminus l^{n+1}} U_{a\concat l_a}\right) \cap \left(\bigcap_{a\in l^{n+1}} U_{a\concat l_a}\right)
      \]
      \[
        =
        V^n_l \cap \left(\bigcap_{a\in k^{n+1}} U_{a\concat l_a}\right)
      \]
      \[
        \subseteq
        V^n_k \cap \left(\bigcap_{a\in k^{n+1}} U_{a\concat k}\right)
      \]
      \[
        =
        V^{n+1}_k
      \]
    \end{enumerate}

    Finally, apply Menger to $\mathcal{V}^n$, resulting in the cover $\{V_{f(0)}^0, V_{f(1)}^1, \dots\}$, noting \[X = \bigcup_{n<\omega}V_{f(n)}^n \subseteq \bigcup_{n<\omega} U_{(f\rest n)\concat f(n)} = \bigcup_{n<\omega} U_{f\rest (n+1)}\]
  \end{proof}

  \begin{proposition}
    $X$ is compact if and only if $F \tactwin \mengame{X}$
  \end{proposition}

  \begin{proof}
    Assume $X$ is compact. For each open cover played by $C$, pick the finite subcover.

    Assume $F$ has a winning tactical strategy. For any open cover, have $C$ play only it during the entire game. $F$'s only choice must be a finite subcover.
  \end{proof}

  \begin{proposition}
    If $X$ is $\sigma$-compact then $F \markwin \mengame{X}$
  \end{proposition}

  \begin{proof}
    Let $X=\bigcup_{n<\omega} X_n$ for compact $X_n$. On round $n$, $F$ picks the finite subcover of $C$'s open cover of $X_n$.
  \end{proof}

  Due to Telgarski in ``On Games of Topsoe'':

  \begin{theorem}
    For metrizable $X$, $X$ is $\sigma$-compact if and only if $F \win \mengame{X}$.
  \end{theorem}

  In a question I posed to G, he answered:

  \begin{lemma}
    For all $\alpha_0, \alpha_1, \dots < \omega_1$ and functions $\tau:\omega_1\times\omega \rightarrow [\omega_1]^{<\omega}$, $\{\tau(\alpha_n,n): n<\omega\}$ is not a cover for $\{\beta:\forall n<\omega (\beta < \alpha_n)\}$.
  \end{lemma} 

  \begin{proof}
    Let $P_n = \{\beta: \beta < \alpha \Rightarrow \beta \in \tau(\alpha, n)\}$. Observe that each $P_n$ is finite; else there is some $\alpha$ larger than every member of $P_n$ such that $P_n \subseteq \tau(\alpha, n)$.

    Choose $\beta \not\in \bigcup_{n<\omega} P_n$. Then for each $n<\omega$, pick $\alpha_n>\beta$ such that $\beta \not\in \tau(\alpha_n, n)$.
  \end{proof}

  Note that the one-point Lindel\"ofication of discrete $\omega_1$, $\oneptlind{\omega_1}$, is not $\sigma$-compact. With the above lemma, we may see that:

  \begin{example}
    $F \win \mengame{\oneptlind{\omega_1}}$ but $F \not\markwin \mengame{\oneptlind{\omega_1}}$.
  \end{example}

  \begin{proof}
    First, we see $F$ has a simple perfect information strategy: in response to the initial cover of $\oneptlind{\omega_1}$, $F$ chooses a co-countable neighborhood of $\infty$. On successive turns she may pick a single set from $C$'s covers to cover the countable remainder.

    Now, suppose that $\sigma(\mc{U}, n)$ was a winning Markov strategy and aim for a contradiction. Consider the covers \[\mc{U}(\alpha) = \{[\alpha,\omega_1)\cup\{\infty\}\} \cup \{\{\beta\}:\beta < \alpha\}\] and define $\tau(\alpha,n)$ to be the union of singletons chosen by $\sigma(\mathcal{U}(\alpha),n)$. As $\sigma$ was a winning strategy, for all $\alpha_0, \alpha_1, \dots < \omega_1$, $\{\sigma(\mathcal{U}(\alpha_n),n): n<\omega\}$ must cover $\oneptlind{\omega_1}$, and thus $\{\tau(\alpha_n,n): n<\omega\}$ must cover $\{\beta:\forall n<\omega (\beta < \alpha_n)\}$, contradiction.
  \end{proof}

  The question remains:

  \begin{question}
    Does $F \markwin \mengame{X}$ imply $X$ is $\sigma$-compact?
  \end{question}

  % Let $\sigma(\mathcal{U},n)$ be $F$'s winning Markov strategy.
