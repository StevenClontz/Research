# Sorgenfrey Project

A side-project for researching an open question on the Sorgenfrey with a few colleagues

## The Question

Per [Gary Gruenhage](http://www.auburn.edu/~gruengf/):

> here’s an open question which is easy to understand and get into, but it could be hard.    It’s a question about the Sorgenfrey line,
i.e., the real line with the right half-open interval topology.  
 
> First, consider the base B of all right half-open intervals.   It is not too hard to show that if C is any subcollection  of B which is also a base
for the space, then C contains a locally finite subcollection C’ which covers the space.   (In fact, one can find a disjoint subcollection C’ covering
the space.) 
 
> Open question:   Let X be the irrational Sorgenfrey line (i.e., the subspace of the Sorgenfrey line consisting of all irrationals).   Is there a base B
for X with the same property?  (I.e., any subcollection C of B which is also a base for X contains a locally finite subcover of X).
 
> A couple of my former students (Porter and Popvassilev) worked on this without success.    I don’t think taking B to be all right half-open intervals
with irrational left endpoints works, but I don’t recall for sure.
