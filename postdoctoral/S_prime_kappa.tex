  \begin{remark}
    Scheeper's \(S(\kappa)\) requiring injections is stronger than my
    \(S'(\kappa)\) requiring finite-to-one maps. Dow suggests that
    \(S'(\omega_2)\) holds in ZFC. Here's my writeup of his argument.
  \end{remark}

  \begin{definition}
    A topological space is said to be \(\omega\)-bounded if each countable
    subset of the space has compact closure.
  \end{definition}

  \begin{claim*}
    There exists a topology on \(\omega_2\) which is locally countable
    and \(\aleph_0\)-bounded.
  \end{claim*}

  \begin{proposition}
    A space which is locally countable and \(\omega\)-bounded is also
    locally compact, locally second-countable, and scattered.
  \end{proposition}

  \begin{proof}
    A countable neighborhood has compact closure by \(\omega\)-boundedness,
    which gives local compactness.

    By local countability, we have local secound-countability.

    TODO: figure out trick to get scattered.
  \end{proof}

  \begin{theorem*}
    \(S'(\omega_2)\).
  \end{theorem*}

  \begin{proof}
    For \(\alpha<\omega_2\), let \(W_\alpha\) be the
    intersection of a countable and compact neighborhood in the claimed topology
    on \(\omega_2\).
  \end{proof}
