We've restructured the proof of the main result (Thm 3.3)
to address the referee's concerns about better motivating
the construction of the tree which is used to define
the winning strategy. Now, before defining T(\emptyset)
and T(s\concat\<x\>), we describe the neighborhoods of H
which will be used in the winning strategy \tau, which we
believe addresses these concerns.

Bell's paper is not yet in print, but she has updated her
definition of the proximal game by replacing 4D_n with D_n,
which matches our defintion. We've added an appropriate
footnote to address this.
