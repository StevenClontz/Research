\begin{abstract}
A topological game $G(X)$ is a two-player game which characterizes
properties of a topological space $X$ based upon the existence of winning
perfect-information
strategies for players in the game. If the property $P$ is characterized by a
player having a winning perfect information strategy, then a property
stronger than $P$ is characterized by that player having a winning
limited information strategy. This paper investigates the existence of
limited information strategies for four types of topological games
from the literature, and the topological properties
characterized by those strategies.
