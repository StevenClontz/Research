# Steven Clontz's Math Research

My repo of research results.

## RESEARCH TODOs

* Investigate Menger property/game
    * Find characterization of Markov strategies in general spaces.
    * Countably compact is equivalent in T_1 to there does not exist an infinite closed discrete subset. Show secound countable T_1: Markov strategy implies sigma-compact.
    * Find characterization of 2-Markov strategies in regular/general spaces.
* Find class of spaces where a 2-tactic in LFKP characterizes metacompact (aka implies 1-tactic)
    * Start with zero-dimensional perhaps.
    * Investigate the ladder space suggested by G.
# General omega-length game result
    * k Markov <-> 2-Markov
    * k Tactic <-> 2-Tactic
    * Start with no uncountable subset is pt-finite.
* Look at Lutzer paper with questions.

## REPO TODOs

* Add undergraduate, masters results
* Organize research into ongoing, completed, and "official" folders
