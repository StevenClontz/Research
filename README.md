# Steven Clontz's Math Research

My repo of research results.

## RESEARCH TODOs

* Investigate Menger property/game
    * Does Markov strategy imply sigma-compact?
* Find class of spaces where a 2-tactic in LFKP characterizes metacompact (aka implies 1-tactic)
    * Start with zero-dimensional perhaps.
* Look at Lutzer paper with questions.

## REPO TODOs

* Add undergraduate, masters results
* Organize research into ongoing, completed, and "official" folders
